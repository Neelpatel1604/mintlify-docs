## Overview

Delete specific documents or vectors from a namespace by providing their IDs. Use the documents endpoint for text data and vectors endpoint for vector data. Both operations are permanent and decrement your total item count.

<Warning>
This operation permanently deletes data and cannot be undone. Deleted items will decrement your total item count.
</Warning>

## Endpoints

- **Documents**: `POST /namespaces/{namespace_name}/documents/delete` - Delete text documents from namespace
- **Vectors**: `POST /namespaces/{namespace_name}/vectors/delete` - Delete vector embeddings from namespace

## Authentication

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Content-Type" type="string" required>
  Must be `application/json`
</ParamField>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="namespace_name" type="string" required>
  Name of the namespace containing the data to delete
</ParamField>

## Body Parameters

<ParamField body="ids" type="array" required>
  Array of item IDs to delete (max 1000 items per request). Numbers will be converted to strings.
</ParamField>

## Response Fields

### Success Response (200)

  Always "success" for 200 responses
</ResponseField>

  Human-readable confirmation message with deletion counts
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="requested_deletions" type="number">
  Number of items requested to be deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="actual_deletions" type="number">
  Number of items actually deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="remaining_items" type="number">
  Total number of items remaining in namespace after deletion
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="requested_ids" type="array">
  List of item IDs that were requested to be deleted
</ResponseField>

### Partial Success Response (207)

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  "partial" for 207 responses
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="unprocessed_ids" type="array">
  IDs of items that failed to be deleted
</ResponseField>

## Important Notes

- Maximum of 1,000 IDs can be deleted in a single request
- IDs can be strings or numbers - they'll be converted to strings internally
- This operation permanently deletes data and cannot be undone
- Successfully deleted items will decrement your total item count
- Use the correct endpoint: documents/delete for text data, vectors/delete for vector data
- Both endpoints use POST method (not DELETE) for security and payload reasons
- Namespace must exist and belong to your account
- The API uses batch deletion for efficient processing

## Understanding Responses

- **200 Response**: No items failed to process (no unprocessed items)
- **207 Response**: Some items were successfully deleted while others failed
- Check `actual_deletions` vs `requested_deletions` to see if items were found
- If `actual_deletions` is 0, the requested IDs may not exist in the namespace
- The `remaining_items` count reflects the current namespace size

## Use Cases

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove outdated or temporary documents/vectors
- **Content Management**: Delete specific items by ID
- **Privacy Compliance**: Remove specific user data
- **Storage Management**: Free up space by removing unused content
- **Testing**: Clean specific test data between runs
