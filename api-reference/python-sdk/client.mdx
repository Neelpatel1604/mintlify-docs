# Client Initialization

The MoorchehClient is the main entry point to the SDK.

## Parameters

<ParamField query="api_key" type="Optional[str]" required>
  Your API key. If None, reads from MOORCHEH_API_KEY environment variable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="base_url" type="Optional[str]">
  The API base URL. If None, reads from MOORCHEH_BASE_URL or uses the production default.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="timeout" type="Optional[float]" default="30.0">
  Request timeout in seconds for all API calls. Defaults to 30.0.
</ParamField>

## Usage

The recommended way to use the client is with a context manager:

```python Basic Usage
from moorcheh_sdk import MoorchehClient

# Recommended: Use as a context manager
with MoorchehClient() as client:
    # ... your code
```

## Authentication Methods

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash Set Environment Variable
export MOORCHEH_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

```python Use Environment Variable
from moorcheh_sdk import MoorchehClient

# API key will be read from environment variable
with MoorchehClient() as client:
    # Client is ready to use
    pass
```

### Direct API Key

```python Direct API Key
from moorcheh_sdk import MoorchehClient

# Pass API key directly (less secure)
with MoorchehClient(api_key="your-api-key-here") as client:
    # Client is ready to use
    pass
```

### Custom Configuration

```python Custom Configuration
from moorcheh_sdk import MoorchehClient

# Custom base URL and timeout
with MoorchehClient(
    api_key="your-api-key-here",
    base_url="https://api.custom-domain.com/v1",
    timeout=60.0
) as client:
    # Client is ready to use
    pass
```

## Context Manager Benefits

Using the client as a context manager ensures:

- Proper cleanup of network resources
- Automatic connection pooling
- Exception handling
- Resource management

<Warning>
Always use the client as a context manager with the `with` statement to ensure proper resource cleanup.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

The client will raise appropriate exceptions for various error conditions:

```python Error Handling
from moorcheh_sdk import MoorchehClient, AuthenticationError

try:
    with MoorchehClient() as client:
        # Your API calls here
        pass
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```
