# Moorcheh MCP Server

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external data sources, tools, and services in a secure and standardized way. It provides a common interface for AI applications to access various resources without needing to understand the specific implementation details of each service.

Think of MCP as a universal translator that allows AI models to communicate with different data sources and tools using a common language, regardless of how those services are implemented.

## Moorcheh MCP Implementation

Our MCP server provides seamless integration with Moorcheh's comprehensive AI capabilities including document embedding, vector storage, semantic search, and AI-powered answer generation. This server enables you to interact with Moorcheh's services through the Model Context Protocol.
